# shtulan-rust (A network authentication tool for Shanghaitech)

## Introduction

No doubt the authentication interface in Shangahitech is stupid and annoying. As geeks, we surely wish to save time and eyeballs. The project of [*WifiLoginer*](../../../WifiLoginer) is a good try, which takes advantage of python's high scalability. This project aims at implementing a Rust version with less runtime cost.

## To-do list

* Add support for heartbeat.
* Add support for configure file.
* Add support for command line arguments.
* Add support for daemon.
* Complete specification.
